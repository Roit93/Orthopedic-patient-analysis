# Orthopedic-patient-analysis
The dataset (Dataset column_3C_weka.csv) classifies the patients in three categories: Normal, Disk Hernia, Spondylolisthesis.

Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (each one is a column):
- pelvic incidence
- pelvic tilt
- lumbar lordosis angle
- sacral slope
- pelvic radius
- grade of spondylolisthesis

The idea is to use these biomechanical features to classify patients according to their labels.
